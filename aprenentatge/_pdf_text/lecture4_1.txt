Generic description
• Instance-based learning (IBL) refers to a family of techniques for classification and  
regression, which produce a class label/regressed value on the basis of a subset 
of the training set
– IBL is a class of supervised learning (SL) algorithm
– The entire training set is needed for training, but, contrary to generic supervised 
learning algorithms, only a subset (of examples) might be needed during use
• IBL algorithms do not build a complete abstraction from all the data stored in the 
training set to build a kind of global model, which can take the form of
– an expression, e.g. the hyperplane that discriminates between two classes 1 and 2:

Generic description
• IBL is also known as memory-based learning, exemplar-based learning, case-
based learning or experience-based learning
• Since there is no abstraction, the subset of examples have to be accessible
– stored in memory
– stored in a database
• To battle the memory complexity of storing all training instances, instance reduction 
algorithms have been developed
– This also provides a way to counteract overfitting
• One advantage that some instance-based learners have over other methods of 
machine learning is its ability to adapt its model to new samples
– Some instance-based learners may simply store a new instance or throw an old instance 
away
• Examples of instance-based learning algorithms are 
– The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, 
– Support Vector Machines (SVM) and in general Kernel machines, 
– Radial Basis Function networks (RBFN), etc.
