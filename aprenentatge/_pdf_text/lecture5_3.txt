Introduction
• These clustering approaches (most popular in unsupervised learning) can be stated 
as the optimization of a cost function J using differential calculus techniques
• The cost function J is defined in terms of the data set X = {x1, x2, …, xN} and the 
clustering R = {C1, C2, …, CM}, for a predefined number of clusters M:
• Each cluster Cj is defined in terms of a set of parameters j, which in turn depend on 
the features of the cluster we look for
– e.g. j can be a point in L-dimensional space corresponding to the centroid of the cluster
• Therefore, the problem becomes into the determination of the optimum set of 
parameters :
• Due to this optimization-based nature, with these algorithms, all the samples of the 
data set 𝑋 are involved in the computation of the parameters of the clusters.

Membership-based clustering
• In a first version, these algorithms define the cost function in the following terms:
– where 𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 1 if sample 𝑥𝑖 is assigned to cluster 𝐶𝑗, otherwise 𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 0
– 𝐽 is optimized with respect to 𝑈 = {𝑢𝑖𝑗} and 𝜃 = {𝜃𝑗}.
 The clustering problem becomes into the determination of optimum 𝑈 and 𝜃.
• if  is DM, the problem is min 𝐽; if  is SM, the problem is max 𝐽
• Example: given 𝑁 = 5 and 𝑀 = 2, the following describes an optimum clustering

i.e. 𝑢11 = 1, 𝑢12 = 0

6
Membership-based clustering
• The previous problem, in which each sample belongs to exclusively one single 
cluster, is known as hard or crisp clustering:
• To find the optimum 𝑈 = {𝑢𝑖𝑗} and 𝜃 = {𝜃𝑗}, we can use differential calculus for 𝜃𝑗, 
but not for 𝑢𝑖𝑗, because 𝐽 is not differentiable with respect to 𝑢𝑖𝑗  {0,1}.
• Instead, we adopt the following (sub-optimum) rule:
– Keeping 𝜃𝑗 constant, 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑀, since for each 𝑥𝑖 only one 𝑢𝑖𝑗 is 1 and the others are 0, 
we set
since 𝐽(𝑋; 𝑈, 𝜃) is minimized if we assign each 𝑥𝑖 to its closest/most similar cluster

Membership-based clustering
• If we now keep constant 𝑈 = {𝑢𝑖𝑗}, we can find 𝜃 = {𝜃𝑗} using differential calculus 
and solving the resulting equation once  is chosen:
• We can now state the Generalized Clustering Hard Algorithmic Scheme (GCHAS):
Alberto Ortiz (last update 19/01/2026)
stage 1: estimate 𝑢𝑖𝑗
keeping 𝜃𝑗 at their 
previous values
stage 2: estimate 𝜃𝑗
keeping 𝑢𝑖𝑗 at their 
previous values
the process can be reversed:
set 𝜃 and next calculate 𝑈

8
Membership-based clustering
• The most popular instance of GCHAS is the so-called K-means algorithm 
(also known as C-means or Isodata)
• Each cluster is represented by its centroid, 𝜃𝑗 = 𝜇𝑗, and  = 𝑑2(𝑥𝑖, 𝜇𝑗)2

Membership-based clustering
• Example: Two Gaussian classes such that
n1 = n2 = 50 − 1 = (10,10), 1 = 2 − 2 = (5,5), 2 = 1
initial centroids: blue squares
6 iterations
final centroids: 1 = (10.24, 9.89), 2 = (5.02, 4.90)

Membership-based clustering
• K-means is used widely and frequently finds reasonable solutions quickly
– It is conceptually simple as well as its implementation
– Its time complexity is O(𝑁𝑀𝑞), where 𝑞 is the number of iterations until convergence
• if 𝑀 <<< 𝑁 and 𝑞 <<< 𝑁, K-means becomes eligible for processing large 
datasets
• However, there are also major shortcomings:
– Although K-means has been proved not to increase 𝐽 between iterations, convergence 
to the global optimum cannot be ensured (solve for the optimum is NP-hard)
• The outcome depends on the initial centroids
– K-means is sensitive to outliers and noise
– One or more clusters can be empty because of centroids too far away from any sample, 
i.e. the cluster has a representative but comprises no samples (due to bad initialization)
• To face these drawbacks:
– One can run K-means several times (with different randomly chosen initial centroids) 
and keep the clustering leading to the lowest value of the cost function 𝐽
– K-means++ modifies the setup stage of K-means by a smarter initialization stage
– K-medoids faces the outlier-sensitivity and naturally avoids empty clusters

11
Membership-based clustering
• K-means++ as initialization of K-means
– The intuition behind K-means++ is that spreading out the 𝑀 initial cluster centroids is 
beneficial, e.g. at least decreases the number of iterations until convergence
– The following pseudo-code assumes the use of a distance as the proximity measure:

Membership-based clustering
• Example: 4 Gaussian clases, 25 samples each


14
Membership-based clustering
• K-medoids – PAM (Partioning Around Medoids) algorithm
– Each cluster is represented by a sample from 𝑋, a medoid, instead of its centroid
– Therefore, the cost function becomes:
where M is the set of samples which are medoids
– At every iteration:
1. K-medoids assigns each sample to the closest medoid ( closest cluster)
2. K-medoids checks whether there exists a sample 𝑥𝑖 which can replace a medoid 𝑥𝑗
and reduce 𝐽
If this is possible, the medoid is redefined and a new iteration takes place; 
otherwise, the process stops
– This procedure:
• avoids empty clusters, i.e. each cluster comprises at least one sample (= medoid),
• tends to be less sensitive to outliers and noise
– CLARA and CLARANS are variants of PAM intended for dealing with large datasets

Membership-based clustering
• A relaxation of constraint 𝑢𝑖𝑗{0,1} leads to the so-called soft clustering problems
• One of these problems is the fuzzy clustering problem, whose formulation is:
where:
–  is a DM for fuzzy clustering algorithms
– 𝑢𝑖𝑗  [0,1] represents the grade of membership of sample 𝑥𝑖 to cluster 𝐶𝑗
• 𝑢𝑖𝑗 is related to 𝑢𝑖𝑘, 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗 because of the constraints
– 𝑞 is named as a fuzzyfier which gives more or less importance to 𝑢𝑖𝑗
 reduces the influence of , what can be useful for dealing with outliers

Membership-based clustering
• Now, we can find the optimum 𝑈 and 𝜃 using differential calculus:
– To find the optimum 𝑈 = {𝑢𝑖𝑗} we need to introduce the following Lagrangian function 
because of the constraints on 𝑢𝑖𝑗:
– The partial derivative of L(𝑋; 𝑈, 𝜃) with respect to 𝑢𝑟𝑠 is
– We can now equal to 0 and solve for 𝑢𝑟𝑠:

17
Membership-based clustering
• Now, we can find optimum 𝑈 and 𝜃 using differential calculus:
– To find the optimum 𝜃 = {𝜃𝑗} we calculate the partial derivative with respect to 𝜃𝑗and 
equal it to 0:
• Summing up, we have:
• There are two issues with the expressions we have just obtained: 
– The expression leading to the calculation of 𝜃 = {𝜃𝑗} depends on the particular proximity
function we are using, so the derivative and the underlying equation cannot be solved in 
general
– Besides, the two expressions are coupled, what prevents from obtaining closed-form 
expressions
• REMARK: Notice that

18
Membership-based clustering
• One way of proceeding is to employ a two-stage iterative algorithm named GCFAS
– the algorithm can also be started from 𝑈(0) instead of 𝜃(0)
– 𝑢𝑖𝑗 cannot be calculated for 𝑥𝑖 if 𝑗 such that (𝑥𝑖 , 𝜃𝑗(𝑡)) = 0, e.g.  is DM
• check this case and set 𝑢𝑖𝑗 so that 𝑥𝑖 is arbitrarily shared among clusters 𝐶𝑗

Membership-based clustering
• If 𝜃𝑗 is a point representative of cluster 𝐶𝑗, e.g. its (fuzzy) centroid, and 
(𝑥𝑖, 𝜃𝑗(𝑡)) is the squared Euclidean distance then:
– The resulting algorithm is named Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) or Soft / Fuzzy k-Means
– This result is also valid if
for 𝐴 symmetric, positive definite (i.e. all eigenvalues are positive)
e.g. 𝐴−1 can be the fuzzy covariance matrix of 𝐶𝑗 : 
In this case, (𝑥𝑖, 𝜃𝑗(𝑡)) is termed as the Mahalanobis distance

• Other FC algorithms: Gustafson-Kessel algorithm for hyperplanes clustering

Membership-based clustering
• Other FC algorithms: hyperellipsoids clustering
– Adaptive Fuzzy C-Shells clustering (AFCS), where a hyperellipsoid is represented by its 
center 𝑐𝑗 and its shape, defined by a symmetric, positive definite matrix 𝐴𝑗, i.e. 𝜃𝑗 = (𝑐𝑗, 𝐴𝑗)
– 𝑑𝑛𝑟 is the normalized radial distance 
(distance to the center of the hyperellipsoid)
– very similar to hyperplanes clustering: 𝐴𝑗 = 𝑗

Membership-based clustering
• Last remarks about membership-based clustering:
– K-means is considered as hard clustering (HC) against FCM which is considered as soft 
clustering (SC) as a result of the relaxation of the membership-related constraints
• Actually, K-means can be regarded as a particular case of FCM
– HC algorithms are not as robust as their SC counterparts when other than point 
representatives are used, e.g. the hard-clustering version of the GK algorithm for 
hyperplanes clustering needs an adequate number of samples from all underlying 
clusters to avoid degenerate cases where Σ𝑗 is not invertible
• If the descriptor of a sample 𝑥𝑖 changes slightly, an HC algorithm might lead to 
reassigning 𝑥𝑖 from one cluster to another, 
while, for the case of a SC algorithm, the membership values 𝑢𝑖∗ might be modified 
but drastic changes will be more difficult to occur
– In general terms, the fuzzy concepts embedded in SC algorithms make them more 
flexible than HC algorithms, i.e. able to deal better with noise and data uncertainty
• By means of FCM, we obtain soft assignments from samples to clusters, what in turn 
reflects assignments uncertainty (because of the data uncertainty itself) 
over the most appropriate assignment

26
Possibilistic clustering
• The formulation for the possibilistic clustering (PC) problem is similar to FC:
where:
–   is a DM for possibilistic clustering algorithms
– 𝑢𝑖𝑗 now represents the grade of compatibility of sample 𝑥𝑖 with cluster 𝐶𝑗 or 
the possibility that sample 𝑥𝑖 belongs to cluster 𝐶𝑗
• 𝑢𝑖𝑗 is no longer coupled to 𝑢𝑖𝑘, 𝑘 ≠ 𝑗, because the constraints have changed
• the possibility that 𝑥𝑖 belongs to 𝐶𝑗 depends on exclusively 𝑥𝑖 and 𝜃𝑗
• it is thus independent of the possibilities that 𝑥𝑖 belongs to any other cluster
– q does not play the same role as in FC, we will clarify this later
– PC behaves better than FC for noisy datasets and 
depends less on a good election of M

Possibilistic clustering
• The direct optimization of the previous cost function leads to the trivial zero-solution
• In order to avoid that situation, we have to incorporate an additional term into J:
– The additional term depends on 𝑢𝑖𝑗 to avoid the zero-solution and also to reduce the 
effect of outliers
– 𝑗 are suitably chosen positive constants, which will be discussed later
• To find the optimum 𝑈 = {𝑢𝑖𝑗} we calculate the partial derivative with respect to 𝑢𝑖𝑗
and equal it to 0:
– 𝑢𝑖𝑗 is inversely dependent on(𝑥𝑖, 𝜃𝑗), what in effect reduces the influence of outliers
• Since the second term of 𝐽 does not involve the cluster representatives 𝜃𝑗, one may 
conclude that the updating of 𝜃𝑗 is carried out the same way as for FC.

Possibilistic clustering
• Generalized Clustering Possibilistic Algorithmic Scheme (GCPAS):
– the algorithm can also be started from 𝑈(0) instead of 𝜃(0)
– there are no longer issues with (𝑥𝑖, 𝑞𝑗(𝑡)) = 0

Possibilistic clustering
• Possibilistic c-Means clustering algorithm (PCM):
Alberto Ortiz (last update 19/01/2026)


30
Possibilistic clustering
• Role of q:
– q determines the kind of “compatibility” 
function implemented by the algorithm
– 𝑞 = 1 ⇒ 𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 0, 𝑥𝑖 | (𝑥𝑖 , 𝜃𝑗) > 𝑗
– 𝑞 → +∞ ⇒ 𝑢𝑖𝑗 tends to constant 0.5, 𝑥𝑖
• Role of 𝒋:
– 𝒋 determines the dissimilarity level between 𝑥𝑖 and 𝐶𝑗 at which 𝑢𝑖𝑗 = 0.5
 defines the “size” and “shape” of the cluster
 defines the influence of a specific point 𝑥𝑖 on the estimation of the 𝐶𝑗 representative
– one way to estimate the value of 𝒋 is to run FCM and after its convergence
Alberto Ortiz (last update 19/01/2026)


31
Possibilistic clustering
• PCM as mode-seeking algorithm:
 minimization of 𝐽 requires maximizing 𝑢𝑖𝑗, which, in turn, requires minimization of (𝑥𝑖, 𝑞𝑗)
 if we run PCM for 𝑀 clusters but 𝑋 comprises 𝐾 < 𝑀 natural clusters, some of the 𝑀
clusters will coincide with others, and hence the number of clusters in 𝑋 need not be known 
a priori 
 𝐶𝑗 are finally placed in regions dense in samples, i.e. the modes of the dataset

32
Possibilistic clustering
• Alternative GCPAS:
– An alternative possibilistic scheme can be derived from a new cost function:
•  𝑞 is no longer involved
– It can be shown that, for this case:
•  𝑢𝑖𝑗 decreases more rapidly than in the standard scheme

Mixture models
• These algorithms assume that there are M clusters underlying the dataset, each 
coming from a population obeying a certain probability distribution, so that the goal is 
to discover the parameters of the mixture. They are also termed as soft clustering.
• We intend to discover the parameters of the three Gaussians (i, i) and the 
assignments of samples to clusters.
Alberto Ortiz (last update 19/01/2026)
Example: We have a dataset 
such as:
… and, in effect, there are 3 clusters, everyone
coming from a different Gaussian:
We guess there are M = 3
clusters normally distributed …

36
Mixture models
• We adopt an optimization-based approach which assigns each sample xi to the cluster with 
highest likelihood: 
and we model the probability of each sample introducing weights j:
since, a priori, we do not know which sample belongs to which cluster,
where:
so that:
• Therefore, the output of the optimization process is the parameters j
of the clusters and the weights rij
– e.g. for the previous example, we can plot samples xi using a 
colour code proportional to the corresponding rij →

37
Mixture models
• Adopting a log-likelihood approach and assuming i.i.d samples, J is defined as:
• The maximum likelihood 
optimization problem hence 
becomes:
– The elements of the N  M matrix Z = {zij} are known as latent variables in this problem.
– rij is named as the responsibility that cluster Cj takes for explaining xi.
– j are the mixing coefficients, which somehow can be seen as the amount of 
explanation of the data performed by cluster Cj.
Alberto Ortiz (last update 19/01/2026)


38
Mixture models
• The mixture problem can be solved by means of the Expectation-Maximization
(EM) algorithm.
– EM is an iterative algorithm that comprises two steps:
• The E step, where the latent variables zij are re-estimated (keeping constant the 
parameters of the clusters)
• The M step, where the distribution parameters are re-estimated (keeping constant 
the latent variables zij)
– EM is useful to solve other problems apart from clustering on the basis of a mixture model
• The most widely used mixture model is the mixture of Gaussians (MOG), also 
called a Gaussian mixture model (GMM):
• Because of the shape of a Gaussian pdf, this algorithm is useful for detecting 
compact and hyperellipsoidal clusters

Mixture models
• Final remarks:
– Remember that, once the mixture model has been fitted, we can make use of
for “hard” sample allocation to clusters
– The E-step can be computationally demanding because of the calculations of j
-1.
• One way to relax this is to assume that all covariance matrices are diagonal or that 
they are all equal to each other (only one inversion is required at each iteration step).
– The EM-GMM algorithm reduces to K-means when j = ^2I and j = 1/M.
